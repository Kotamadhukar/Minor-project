**SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning**
 **Project Overview**

This academic Minor Project focuses on developing an intelligent system to automatically detect and classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Legitimate) using Machine Learning techniques in Python. The project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze textual patterns and improve classification accuracy, helping to reduce unwanted messages and enhance communication safety.

 **Objectives**

To build a system that automatically identifies spam SMS messages
To preprocess and clean raw text data effectively
To apply machine learning algorithms for text classification
To evaluate and compare model performance

**Features**

SMS message classification (Spam / Ham)
Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stop-word removal, punctuation removal)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
Training and testing multiple machine learning models
Model performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
Simple GUI-based interaction using Tkinter

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language
Python

**Libraries & Frameworks**
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Tkinter
WordCloud
Machine Learning Models
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest

**Project Workflow**

Load and explore the SMS dataset
Handle missing values and clean data
Label encode spam and ham messages
Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing
Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
Train multiple machine learning classifiers
Evaluate models using accuracy and confusion matrix
Predict spam or ham for new SMS inputs

**Dataset**

SMS dataset containing labeled messages (Spam / Ham)
Dataset is preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns and handle null values

 **Application Interface**

Dataset upload option
Data preprocessing and visualization
Model training and comparison
SMS prediction input
Confusion matrix visualization

 **How to Run the Project**

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kotamadhukar/Minor-project.git
